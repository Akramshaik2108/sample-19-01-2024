        <p style="text-align: justify;">would always be in the direction of an accountable project office with
responsibility for managing all project. This is an error common to all systems
of thought with large projection, to think that if something is good, more is
necessarily better. Instead, the project office should reflect the organizational
structure and the allocation of projects inside the organization. The mere
existence of a project office, no matter what type, represents a commitment
on the part of the organization to improve project management. The most
            successful project offices specialize in both project management and evangelism, that is, they fight for their values (Verzuh, 1999).</p>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;"><u>Maturity Models</u></h2>
        <h2><u>Capability Maturity Model (CMM)</u></h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The implementation of formal efficiency procedures is quite new in IT projects.
There are different approaches regarding the best practices in the IT project
            management (Carvalho et al., 2003; Laurindo et al., 2003).</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Humphrey (1989) identifies maturity levels in the IT project development
process, based on the managerial behavior found in companies. The fundamental concepts of the maturity process derive from the belief that the development
management process is evolutionary. Paulk et al. (1995) identify the distinguishing characteristics between immature and mature organizations, as shown
            in Table 4.2.</p><br>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Table 4.2. Immature organization mature organization (Paulk et al.,
            1995)</i></p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/img1.jpeg" alt="Description of the image"></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The CMM (Humphrey, 1989; Paulk et al., 1995; Pessôa and Spinola, 1997)
was developed by SEI — the Software Engineering Institute, of Carnegie
Mellon University, and presents five maturity levels, each corresponding to a
            set of structural requirements for key process areas. (Figure 4.2)</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Although each project is unique, it could be organized in a process to be applied
in other projects. IT projects managers used to apply a “methodology,” i.e. they
establish the steps to be followed in order to develop a system. Another singular
characteristic is the dynamic technologies breakthrough that demands continuous improvements in the development methods and management of changing
            process, as described in CMM model, at level 5, the highest level of maturity.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The CMM second level has a consistent project management structure and the
goal of this level is to deliver projects on time. To perform this, the model have
several points that must be achieved, like effort and size estimation, strong
process control (such as periodic meetings between technical people and
            managers), and several measures to show project status more clearly.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">CMM is not an adequate reference for the assessment of internal methodologies, since it was not conceived to perform this kind of analysis. ISO 15504
(1998) proposed the standard project SPICE as a more appropriated model
to evaluate maturity level of specific processes. While CMM level of maturity
specifies a set of processes that have to be performed, ISO 15504 establishes
maturity levels for each individual process: level 0-incomplete; level 1-performed; level 2-managed; level 3-established; level 4-predictable; level 5-
optimizing. This is a different approach of CMM, since an organization does not
perform a maturity level, but has a maturity profile: a maturity level is measured
            for each specific process. This new approach is a very useful to the organization</p><br>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Figure 4.2. Maturity levels (adapted from Paulk et al., 1995)</i></p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/img2.jpeg" alt="Description of the image"></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">perspective because one can easily measure strong and weak points of their
process and plan improvement activities. Furthermore, from the companie’s
point of view, it is easier to understand staged levels as the performed
            processes are already predefined.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The SPICE approach defined in standard ISO 15504 (1998) had originally
influenced <i>CMM for Systems Engineering,</i> published in 1995, and more
recently influenced CMM I (CMM-I1; CMM-I2), just published in 2002.
CMM-I, the integration model, was enhanced in two dimensions: <i>scope
            dimension and evaluation dimension.</i></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">In the scope dimension, this new model incorporated other published models
and covers all project activities, not only software, as the original software
CMM did, but also other engineering fields. In the evaluation dimension,
CMM-Il incorporated both approaches: the traditional (called staged CMM)
and the maturity profile (called continuous CMM). Figure 4.3 shows the
continuous CMM-I representation to be compatible with ISO/IEC 15504
            standard.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">CMM-I (and software CMM) considers that maturity level is an organizational
characteristic and it is independent of the professionals involved. Nowadays,
there is a strong tendency towards the adoption of CMM-I models, which were
sponsored by Department of Defense (DoD), meanwhile, ISO standards are
            less used.</p><br>

        <h2><u>Project Management Maturity Model (PMMM)</u></h2>
         <p style="text-align: justify;">Project Management plays an important role in the competitive scenario, and
achieved in the 1990s the status of methodology. The model proposed by
Project Management Institute - PMI (2000), called Project Management Body
of Knowledge (PMBoK), provides a framework to manage project efficiency,
balancing scope expectations and the available resources in nine key areas
             (Rabechini & Carvalho, 1999).</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Nevertheless, the PMBoK framework cannot provide a standard benchmark
for project management capability as CMM to software engineering capabilities. In order to extend the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) to project
management, Kerzner (2000, 2001) proposes a Project Management Maturity
            Model (PMMM).</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The PMMM differs in many aspects from the CMM, but this framework also
introduces benchmarking instruments for measuring an organization’s progress
along the maturity model, detailing five levels of development for achieving
            maturity, as shown in Figure 4.4 (Carvalho et al., 2003).</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">It is important to highlight the differences in terminology between the CMM and
PMMM, (compare Figures 4.3 and 4.4) which could lead to misunderstanding
when both models are being implemented in the IT domain of the same
            organization.</p><br>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Figure 4.4. Project Management Maturity Model (adapted from Kerzner,
2001)</i></p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/img4.jpeg" alt="Description of the image"></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">PMMM addresses the key knowledge areas across the project management
process, in compliance with PMBoK, and integrates them with the Project
            Management Office — PMO in the strategic level.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Kerzner (2000) identifies a life cycle in PMMM level 2, common processes,
which could be broken into five phases, as shown in Figure 4.5. It is important
            to note that some simultaneity among the phases can occur.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The embryonic phase means that the organization starts to recognize the
benefits of project management — PM, usually by lower and middle levels of
            management. The two next phases are achieved when the PM concepts are </p><br>
